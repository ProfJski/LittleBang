# Little Bang
## OpenCL many-body gravity simulator with *collision* and *coalescence*

A many-body gravity simulator is a common OpenCL demonstration of how hardware parallelism can grapple better with the O(n^2) nature of an n-body gravitational system.  It's also a wonderful example of how a discrete computational approach achieves results impossible for traditional analysis.  That's great.

Yet most gravity simulators miss what I feel is the most exciting part: a particle cloud coalescing into larger orbiting bodies.  That's what Little Bang provides: masses collide and then they can either recoil, shatter or coalesce together.  Eventually, a cloud of particles gathers into larger bodies.  And if the parameters are just right and you're lucky, you might even get a nice little solar system.
